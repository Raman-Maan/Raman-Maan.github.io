A website that started as a hackathon project to learn about web; it's now gone through a few iterations! Here they are below:

1) The Original

My first foray into web design. Yikes.

2) The Less Ugly

I decided to leverage cool libraries to do the heavy lifting for me for the cool technical features I wanted, like the particles. Originally I created the website as a mock terminal that was interacted with through the command line, but my exectution of it wasn't great and I worried it would be difficult to interact with for anyone who hasn't used a terminal before. That's where the typed header on the top came from, as a bit of a relic from that.

### Some of the cool things I used:
- jQuery
- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/)
- [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/)

3) Present

Visit it at [ramanmaan.io](http://ramanmaan.io).

With a little bit of web experience under my belt this time around, I decided very quickly I'd be offloading most of the work onto a templating engine, and I chose Jekyll for the convenient Github Pages functionality.
